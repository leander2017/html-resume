        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            <p>My name is Axel (34) and I live in Eberswalde (Germany), near Berlin.</p>
            I'm seeking employment in the IT industry in the field of web development. 
            For this purpose I'm already taking advantage of training opportunities at the Distance Learning University in Hagen and 
            the Institute for Lernsysteme in Hamburg (ILS) as well as various online courses. 
            Up to now I could acquire a solid basic knowledge in the area of object-oriented programming, 
            which I will expand to technologies for web development by the end of the year, 
            in order to be able to start in the application phase in 2024.
